# Journi Component Library

Components combine styling, behavior and business rules into reusable, composable units. To assist in rapid product development, each component should:

-   Provide event tagging
-   Support accessibility and internationalization
-   Support testable anchors and attributes
-   Maintain consistent brand styling
-   Support responsive displays
-   Manage interaction states (active, valid, hover, etc...)
