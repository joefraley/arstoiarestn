Feature: personas

  AS A Journi web app tester
  I WANT to have a set of known test personas, each with predictable, unchanging data
  SO THAT my tests know what to expect when they refer to those personas

  These personas represent the types of users for whom the team is developing
  the application. The personas are used to build user empathy and shared understanding
  of users by team members.

  These Gherkin scenarios document the personas and ensure that the data
  associated with each persona doesn't drift. For example, if someone accidentally
  changes a persona's GroupID in the test database, these tests will catch that change
  and alert us that other tests that use the same persona might also fail.
